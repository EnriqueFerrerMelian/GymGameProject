##GymGameProyect
I'm tryng to make a videogame that helps me go to the gyms and motivate me while I exercise. (Original title: "I'm tryng to make a videogame that helps me go to the gyms and don't feel like shit while I exercise.")

##📝 Description
This app is based on an old gym app I developed for my last year project. The old app was supposed to help you manage the exercises you do, rutines, grafics, etc. 
This new version will add game-like features. You will earn points for completing exercises. With these points, you can upgrade your main character (created uppon registration). And I am still working on the content. I just got the idea while cycling at the gym :/

##🌟 Features
    Functionality A: Create custom routines.
    Feature B: Track your improvements through statistics.
    Functionality C: See the activities available in your gym.
    Functionality D: View news on the Notice Board.
    Functionality E: Compare your graphics with those of other users.

##🛠 Installation Requirements
    Probably the lowest possible requirements.

##▶ Use

    Everything can be a video game if you make it so.
